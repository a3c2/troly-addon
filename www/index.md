# The A3C2 Project

### From QR Code, to product information and repeat sales.

This project was created to make QR codes, digital production information technology easily available, affordable, flexible and safe for businesses of all sizes, and in every industry.

#### Available

While generating a QR code may often be deemed as "simple", too many do not use QR codes due to fear of "what they are locking themselves into", lack of knowledge, or mere lack of time.

#### Affordable

QR codes is a simple technology, leveraging [established standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code#Standards), and can be generated freely using a miriad of technologies. Many platforms however leverage a lack of knowledge to charge a higher price, making it prohibitively expensive to many.

### Flexibility

Using a plugin model, several capabilities can added seamlessly, as well as individually isolated, to offer complete flexibility and granularity to all business using QR codes to show product information to the customers.

#### Safety

To prevent any kind of vendor lock-in, the A3C2 project was built to enable complete control over QR codes generated
